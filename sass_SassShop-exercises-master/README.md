# SassShop Exercises

This repository contains a set of exercises to go along with the SassShop.com workshop curriculum.

**If you are participating in the workshop, you'll want to use `exercises/kittens` as your _working directory_.**

If you need a little help or inspiration while working through the exercises, you can find solutions for each exercise in the `exercises/completed` directory.
